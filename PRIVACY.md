### Details on how Samplescope processes and stores your data.

The app tracks some of its behavior for analytics and bug tracking.

## Bug Tracking

[Bugsnag.com](https://www.bugsnag.com/) used to monitor the app's stability and errors.
ALL errors data collected anonymously with randomly generated id. Some general system information that can be considered personal are collected, for example, OS name (e.g. _Mac OS X 10.15_), system language (e.g. _en-GB_), and user time zone.
IP information or other personal info ARE NOT COLLECTED / STORED.
See exact [Tracking Code](https://github.com/jamland/samplescope/blob/main/src/modules/analytics/bugsnag.renderer.tsx).

## Analytics

There is tracking analytics enabled by default. Analytics collected with [https://www.nucleus.sh/](https://www.nucleus.sh/). `Nucleus` collects some information related to app use while app running, specifically it collects all search text requests and names of downloaded files.
Tracking analytics also collects some information, which could be considered as personal information, specifically it anonymously tracks how many unique users use application with randomly generated uniq ID, user's OS system, OS language, and Country. Here is an example of a tracked query:

```
User: 1cb1b608-e5dc-4cc7-84bd-afe64cbab303
OS: macOS Sierra, English
Country: Ukraine
```

No other personal information is collected. All information collected only for analyzing application use. It is not shared with 3rd-party.

Google Analytics is not an active ATM. It can be activated later though.
